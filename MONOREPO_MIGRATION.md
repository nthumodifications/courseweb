# Monorepo Migration Plan

This document outlines the complete migration plan for reorganizing the courseweb project into a well-structured monorepo. This migration will improve code organization, enable better code sharing, and provide a foundation for scaling the project.

## Overview

We're migrating from a flat repository structure to a modern monorepo using:

- **Turborepo** for build orchestration and caching
- **npm workspaces** for dependency management
- **Clear separation** between apps, services, packages, and tools

## Target Structure
